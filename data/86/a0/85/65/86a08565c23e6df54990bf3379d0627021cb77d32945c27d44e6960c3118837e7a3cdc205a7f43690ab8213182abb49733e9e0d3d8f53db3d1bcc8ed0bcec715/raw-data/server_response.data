        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>So I reviewed this app half a year ago mentioning that the app works great for my use case, but every single time I want to download a file I find it almost impossible to select the file on the first try. The tiny button you have to push to open the share menu requires so much precision to press that it is always an annoyance. While the new redesign did not fix the button itself, it added a pop-up at the bottom of the app when you add a new file which allows you to access the share menu with a much bigger button. Not the fix I was expecting, but totally solved my problem. _______________________________________ Original review: The (...) button on each file is almost impossible to tap, at least on the iPhone 12 Mini. I have to try at least 6 times times every time I want to download a video, meanwhile the video will start up every time I miss the button by a few pixels. I don’t have thick fingers it’s just a really small area the button will accept a tap from. Please make it bigger.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Very nice app to help organize all the files as well as see them...and then do something with them as needed. It is an Efficient app and I use it a lot. But I do wish they would do a better job INTEGRATING their apps to work together much more efficiently, and auto magical...and not need to go searching through the next doc or pic managing app u need. Like the printer app they have should open automatically after u send a web doc or photo to it but you have to hunt for the app...THEN name and save the file or pic to manage the data! That’s very cumbersome. I also wish the printer app work with this app. <br />I’d love for them to make an app that allows us to manage our photos and screen shots right away as we take the photo or screen capture. I have 1000s of screen shots in a mess even though I try to use photo folders. But they are too small of photos to see to do mass classification. I like this Doc app because u can tag things easily and also see them reasonably well (although I Wish there was a “space less” version that has the images as big as possible so we can see them and peg it with the correct tags when we are doing group classifications.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I use this app everyday for PDF annotation with my apple pencil. Previously you could have 4 different pens saved with different colors, opacities, and thicknesses. Now you only get one and you have to manually change the settings every time you want to use a different color. The only way around this I can find is if you pay $50 a year to save different writing utensils in the favorites. I am extremely disappointed as I don&#39;t have the time to manually change the color and thickness every 30 seconds while I am switching back and forth for work. Also, before with the apple pencil, I could use the pencil once with one of the mark up tools and after that my finger would only scroll. Now each time I switch writing utensils, when I attempt to scroll with my finger, it writes instead of scrolling. Even when selecting the utensil with the pencil, it often requires me to select it several times before it will write. When switching between different lined pdf documents, the lines will often disappear and I will have to quit the app and restart it for the lines to come back. Used to be 5 stars, now down to 1 until they fix these issues. I am really disappointed, this was the most useful app and I loved everything about it, but this update has made me want to find a new app to replace this one.</p>

The tiny button you have to push to open the share menu requires so much precision to press that it is always an annoyance. While the new redesign did not fix the button itself, it added a pop-up at the bottom of the app when you add a new file which allows you to access the share menu with a much bigger button. Not the fix I was expecting, but totally solved my problem. _______________________________________ Original review: The (...) button on each file is almost impossible to tap, at least on the iPhone 12 Mini. I have to try at least 6 times times every time I want to download a video, meanwhile the video will start up every time I miss the button by a few pixels. I don’t have thick fingers it’s just a really small area the button will accept a tap from.

That’s very cumbersome. I also wish the printer app work with this app. \nI’d love for them to make an app that allows us to manage our photos and screen shots right away as we take the photo or screen capture. I have 1000s of screen shots in a mess even though I try to use photo folders. But they are too small of photos to see to do mass classification. I like this Doc app because u can tag things easily and also see them reasonably well (although I Wish there was a “space less” version that has the images as big as possible so we can see them and peg it with the correct tags when we are doing group classifications.","title":"Liking \u0026 using more than expected!","userName":"Roxiepup6"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5256207343","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-12-10T15:22:31Z","developerResponse":{"id":19953334,"body":"Hi,\nThank you immensely for sharing your feedback in regards to the app's improvement.\nI'm glad to inform you that the 4 separate Pen options are back.

Previously you could have 4 different pens saved with different colors, opacities, and thicknesses. Now you only get one and you have to manually change the settings every time you want to use a different color. The only way around this I can find is if you pay $50 a year to save different writing utensils in the favorites. I am extremely disappointed as I don't have the time to manually change the color and thickness every 30 seconds while I am switching back and forth for work. Also, before with the apple pencil, I could use the pencil once with one of the mark up tools and after that my finger would only scroll. Now each time I switch writing utensils, when I attempt to scroll with my finger, it writes instead of scrolling. Even when selecting the utensil with the pencil, it often requires me to select it several times before it will write. When switching between different lined pdf documents, the lines will often disappear and I will have to quit the app and restart it for the lines to come back. Used to be 5 stars, now down to 1 until they fix these issues.

I have done the initial deletion, and then the secondary “permanent” deletion, but the data itself still remains somewhere in the iPad. \nHere is an example of what I mean. Recently I needed more space on my iPad. I checked how much storage the Documents app was taking up, noting the total being used was 6.98 gigs. After deleting several hundred megs worth of files (using the two step deletion process), I checked the storage situation again. The total storage being used by the app had increased to 7.05 gigs. (I also previously removed the Documents folder from the iOS Files app.)\nIn short, I am being robbed of storage by the app. I don’t appreciate being robbed.\nOf course I could try and fully delete the app and see if that would solve my woes, but why should I have to? Why does the two step delete function not actually delete the files I want to delete? Uninstalling and reinstalling would mean I would have to move all my information back over and reorganize it as well. Why should I have to do that instead of simply being able to delete my files permanently?","title":"Cannot Permanently Delete Data","userName":"Ellis Jaiye"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3585501313","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-12-29T00:25:30Z","rating":4,"review":"I’ve been using this app for a little over a year now and there was never really any problems.

It supports all the major cloud services, Nextcloud, and local SMB so that’s great. And it’s a capable video player.\n\nIt does sometimes just decide to remove all your favorites, usually after an update. So that’s frustrating. But deleting and reinstalling fixes the problem but you do have to fav everything again.\n\nI kind of wish the browser and VPN were a separate app. I mean really, who is going to look to documents as a browser, it’s literally called “documents”\n\nThe b be on service might be worthwhile but I have no idea what there logging looks like and I don’t know if it suppers apps outside documents ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nCan’t comment on the browser because I’ve literally never once used it - why would I now that safari finally has extensions? Chrome, FF, Brave, etc have the browser market pretty locked down, especially since all iOS browsers have to use WebKit so they’re basically all the same anyway unless it’s a major enough company to really build out a custom app like brave. The rest are, meh, but at least they’re apps, not a browser inside of another app.\n\nReally, documents is great, I’d pay for a pro version for the sake of supporting developers but I’m never gonna buy this VPN/Browser thing, it’s just redundant and really, there are other apps that do it all better / are more transparent. Just stick to being a really amazing document browser / file\u0026media opening app.","title":"One of the best","userName":"DrPeril"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7805334488","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-09-14T13:29:58Z","developerResponse":{"id":25284968,"body":"Hello, we apologize for your negative experience with the app - could you please contact us at rdsupport@readdle.com so that we can help?

I couldn’t understand what was going on until finally I went into the app settings and manually disabled the VPN and now everything is working again.  \n\nAlso, I don’t know why you decided to hide a lot the features that previously were on the bottom bar into sub-menus in the app. It was fine before. I liked having the computer connect button accessible. I had to look for 5 minutes just to find it. Now all the video files I send over to edit on my phone have no preview images and the font for the file names all cut off. In making things look all flashy, you took away from the simplicity that made the app easy to use. \n\nI’d probably have more issues if I used for more than 5 minutes but I haven’t received an email or text message or been able to connect to websites or refresh my social media feeds in 12 hours since it updated.","title":"8.0 Docs X
