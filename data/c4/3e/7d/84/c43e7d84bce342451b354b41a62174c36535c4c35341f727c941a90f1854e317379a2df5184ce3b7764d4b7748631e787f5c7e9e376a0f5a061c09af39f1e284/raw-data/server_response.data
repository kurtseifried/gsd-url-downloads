        </header>
        <p>This is a tale of two attitudes.</p>
<p>Working on a project for a client recently, I needed to speak the SSH protocol
in <a href="https://golang.org/" title="The Go Programming Language">Golang</a> code.  So I started with the <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh" title="package ssh">x/crypto/ssh</a> package, part of
the suite of libraries from the Golang developers which is not part of the
standard library and not part of their usual compatibility guarantees, but
more along the lines of &ldquo;useful stuff which might graduate to the standard
library&rdquo;.</p>
<p>There I am, happy with a great API with clean representations of the
underlying concepts and generally clean use, until I get to &ldquo;okay, we need to
verify the remote server's hostkey &hellip; how do I do that?&rdquo; and I quickly
realized that this seemed to involve some grotty work at a lower level of
abstraction than the rest of the API seemed to require of the programmer.</p>
<p>Rather than reinvent the wheel, I turned to my favorite search engine to see
how other projects managed this and started reading the results.  Then
panicking a little and searching other projects.  I then turned to the
projects of a well-known vendor of Golang-based tooling in the DevOps space
and checked them, and panicked a little more.</p>
<p>I've yet to find a project which actually bothered implementing hostkey
verification in SSH client code.  None.</p>
<p>I sent off two bug-reports.  Both PGP encrypted messages, one to the vendor of
the tooling whose products were dangerously buggy and one to the Golang
maintainers.</p>
<h3 id="the-tooling-vendor">The Tooling Vendor</h3>
<p>The tooling vendor decided that this is <strong>Not A Bug</strong>.  They're updating their
documentation to reflect this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To clarify this for our users, we will be updating our documentation to
reflect our recommendations to securely operate our tools, as well as
explicitly highlighting that we do not support SSH Host Key checking at
this time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other responses included that they got into console parsing (to extract
host-keys from those printed by <code>cloud-init</code> at startup) with a previous
product and it was too hard, so they don't want to ever do it again, and that
the benefits of TOFU (Trust On First Use) for them are minimal.  Also that the
exploitability of the trust paths is low.</p>
<p>To me, this is deeply concerning.  They're saying that people should securely
operate their tools, at the same time as making it hard to securely operate
their tools.  They're not warning people to not invoke the tools talking
across the open Internet.  They've shown that they're unaware of tools such as
<code>mitmproxy</code> which perform <em>exactly</em> this sort of attack, while purveying tools
designed to improve security and, oh yes, manage SSH keys on hosts too.</p>
<p>The only way to securely use such tools is to absolutely trust the network
between the machine invoking the tool and the resources being talked to.  At
which point, why bother with cryptography at all?</p>
<p>Sure, TOFU doesn't help if you <em>never</em> cache the results, so that <em>every</em>
use is effectively &ldquo;<em>first</em>&rdquo; use.
That's not TOFU, that's trust on every use.  Unverified.
Further, when their tooling is creating resources and seeing them soon after
boot, they're in a good position to see logged hostkeys.  They can be
compatible-by-default with the most common tooling and decline to work without
override if people try to work without making those keys available for
verification.</p>
<p>The parsing is pretty easy to do with systems such as AWS EC2, I've done it:
use <code>ec2:GetConsoleOutput</code>, look for the markers, extract the hostkeys between
them.  This can be written in such a way as to be extensible to other output
formats.  But it's incredibly immature to decide &ldquo;it's too hard and too much
work, so we won't bother and we'll leave people vulnerable and tell them it's
their fault if they use our tool in the way that most guides and documentation
suggests&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So they could verify hostkey identity absolutely; with less work, they could
just get the usual TOFU semantics by caching the observed SSH hostkeys.
Instead, they have no verification and the tools are thus unfit to use when
they connect via SSH across the public Internet.</p>
<p>I used to respect this vendor and recommend their tools to others.  I am
having to rethink this a lot.  I am no longer happy to recommend Hashicorp
products to others.</p>
<h3 id="the-language-maintainers">The Language Maintainers</h3>
<p>I am bemused by an approach to accepting security reports which is to go
through the motions of having PGP public keys available for people to use to
report issues but upon receiving such a request ask for it to be submitted
without PGP because digging out the keys is too much of a hassle.</p>
<p>Mind, we are overdue for some nice convenient tooling to have a
PGP-decrypting-and-reencrypt-to-subscribers mailing-list software tool for use
for such public contact points.  I can see the point, even as I face-palm at
the attitude and the cargo-cult approach to public contact points for security
reports.</p>
<p>(Thus last week was a little depressing for looking at the state of the
industry).</p>
<p>But things got much better after that.</p>
<p><a href="https://golang.org/issue/19767" title="x/crypto/ssh: make ClientConfig HostKeyCallback non-permissive by default">Golang issue 19767</a> was filed; the Golang maintainers decided to go public
immediately.  They decided to make a breaking change to their API, as they
allow themselves to do for packages in the <code>golang.org/x/</code> namespace.</p>
<p>They quickly fixed the library such that leaving the <code>HostKeyCallback</code> field
of client configs unset would result in all calls failing.  They provided a
<code>InsecureIgnoreHostKey</code> function which could be explicitly assigned to get the
old behavior and <code>FixedHostKey</code> to verify against one key, then provided an
example function which comes closer to classic SSH behavior by providing a
simplistic parse of the <code>known_hosts</code> file (first match only, ignoring
algorithm in selection, etc) &ndash; it works.</p>
<p>Despite breaking changes being <em>allowed</em> here, they're still discouraged and
fairly rare.  They did take the opportunity to be very explicit in the package
documentation, adding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This package does not fall under the stability promise of the Go language
itself, so its API may be changed when pressing needs arise.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-future">The Future</h3>
<p>Every software package using <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh" title="package ssh">x/crypto/ssh</a> for implementing an SSH client
which is not already doing hostkey verification will need to be updated to
handle this.</p>
<p>Anyone who complains and says &ldquo;this is why we need to vendor library
dependencies&rdquo; should need to explain why it would be better for their product
to keep a security flaw in it and not be pressed to update.  A bunch of Google
engineers recently volunteered a large amount of time and work to fixing a
similar issue which turned out to be vendored deeply into the Java ecosystem,
in the “Mad Gadget” vulnerability fix.  Vendoring protects engineering time at
the expense of embedding vulnerabilities deeper and making it harder to fix
them all.</p>
<p>Anyone using SSH as a client in Golang who wants to keep being insecure will
need to explicitly mark it as such in their codebase and face public ridicule.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2017-3204"><code>CVE-2017-3204</code></a></p>
<hr>
<p>PS: I ran a Twitter poll about what most vendors would do, poll lasting one
week:<br>
<a href="https://twitter.com/philpennock/status/849420403508432902"><img src="/postimage/2017/twitter-golang-ssh-pollresults.png" alt="Poll results"></a><br>
Across 185 votes, only 27% felt that software vendors would actually fix the
security problems in their software.</p>
<p>Whether this cynicism is undue, or merely resigned realism, I leave to your
analysis.  Fortunately, time will give us real answers: we can revisit this a
year from now and see what has changed.</p>

  I do have a sense of humor. It's often dry or quirky. Various expeditions

  but equally, they haven't <em>disproven</em> its existence, so I'm still in
  the game.
