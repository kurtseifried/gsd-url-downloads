        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have been loving Nikes ever since my dad bought my first pair for me when I was 13. I can’t always afford them because I’m retired and on a fixed income but I wouldn’t purchase any other athletic product because I’ve always believed that they put out the best their consumers and their athletes. I used to weight 236 lbs and had Cancer, diabetes, heart failure and end stage kidney failure. I was terminal and dying but I’m happy to say that I am 110 lbs, healthy and disease-free. My Nike got me through it all, mind, body and spirit. Something about wearing the best, looking your best and being comfortable makes you feel your best and that’s exactly what Nike has always done for me. I had a hip replacement surgery and wearing Nike gave me the strength to get through learning to walk again and become full functioning again. Unfortunately, I have to get another but I won’t “ Just do it “ , without you! Thank you Nike for your dedication to excellence and your loyal customers. I truly appreciate you all!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Been using this app for several years now.  Easy to search/find, good selections, timely notice for sale, and recently added “new drop” list is very convenient.  I like “notification” function, as sometime I overlook for a drop.  <br />Chat service is excellent.  They are always friendly yet polite also.  Response time is always w/in few minutes after posting.  <br />Only problem is some items shows video of items not available colors.  (Sometime I like the color of video item better)<br />One point I appreciate if can be done.  Some clothing shows a model wearing top, bottom, shoes, caps, etc, but only listed for 1 item like hoodie.  I have to look for the bottom, but can’t find it sometime.  I wish sku number was listed for what’s in a photo.  The same can be applied for cover photo of item, like shoes.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’m a huge Nike fan but I’m not a fan limited drops for shoes or clothes. I finally decided to get some of the shoes that I really liked (Día de los Muertos collection if anyone is asking) their official announcement said they where dropping on October 15th and I checked this app and the sneakers app and nothing. It wasn’t until I went online to Twitter that I find out they were not dropping until the 27th. So, I wait... Same thing. I wait and check both apps when the collection is supposed to drop nothing. Online says until the 30th. Third time around and part of the collection finally drops. I order my shoes exactly at 7:00am. Two days later my order is cancel with no explanation. I immediately contact customer support and they tell me they have sold out. Then I asked them about the other part of the collection that was never dropped and they claim it was dropped the 27th. It’s just so frustrating that they oversell and don’t have enough stock for those who purchased. I wasn’t the only one they did this too. More frustrating that there is no info on drops changing dates and have to get info from non Nike employees. Definitely deserves 1 star and truly disappointed with Nike.</p>

I used to weight 236 lbs and had Cancer, diabetes, heart failure and end stage kidney failure. I was terminal and dying but I’m happy to say that I am 110 lbs, healthy and disease-free. My Nike got me through it all, mind, body and spirit. Something about wearing the best, looking your best and being comfortable makes you feel your best and that’s exactly what Nike has always done for me. I had a hip replacement surgery and wearing Nike gave me the strength to get through learning to walk again and become full functioning again.

I finally decided to get some of the shoes that I really liked (Día de los Muertos collection if anyone is asking) their official announcement said they where dropping on October 15th and I checked this app and the sneakers app and nothing. It wasn’t until I went online to Twitter that I find out they were not dropping until the 27th. So, I wait... Same thing. I wait and check both apps when the collection is supposed to drop nothing. Online says until the 30th. Third time around and part of the collection finally drops. I order my shoes exactly at 7:00am. Two days later my order is cancel with no explanation. I immediately contact customer support and they tell me they have sold out. Then I asked them about the other part of the collection that was never dropped and they claim it was dropped the 27th. It’s just so frustrating that they oversell and don’t have enough stock for those who purchased. I wasn’t the only one they did this too. More frustrating that there is no info on drops changing dates and have to get info from non Nike employees.

I copped the Jordan 13s like in the middle of the week. Which shocked me cause I thought copping Jordan’s would b me that easy. Boy was I wrong. When Jordan’s drop trying to get a pair is IMPOSSIBLE. It’s a game basically. The app stores all your info; name, address, even card info. So you go to the app on the day of a drop, 7am, thinking you’re gonna get a win that day. You find the shoes you want. Confirm that you want them. Then you’re placed in a “waiting room” for 5 mins. They you’ll get an alert saying “we don’t have your size” WHO IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE.  It’s like you go to the mall. Go into a store and pick out the shoes you want, size and all. You go to the register and give them your credit card. After they swipe it they tell you “go sit over there and wait before you walk out”. Then the person working in the store says “oh can I have your shoes back. This person who just walked in wants them”. I get Nike doesn’t really care as long as they’re selling shoes. But these guys with the “bots” are the ones that keep getting the shoes. Why not make those guys verify that they aren’t “bots”. Just my thoughts.

So with that being said, a lot of the time the app isn’t up to date on what products they actually have to sell you and it’s super frustrating. I get that stuff like this happens but they should at least have a waiting list or some type of system set up so you can receive the product you bought at some point. I just think that if you already transferred money to them for a product then you should be priority (on a waiting list or something) for when they are restocked instead of leaving you in the dust and saying “sikkke, yeah we actually aren’t gonna sell you that bc we messed up with inventory, here’s your money back tho, hopefully you get the product before the next time it sells out 😬”.","title":"JUST DO BETTER","userName":"There was no other names"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7182689696","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-04-04T13:08:32Z","rating":5,"review":"Great app, user friendly and great deals to steal if you’re a random window shopper just looking to spend (haha) so truthfully I’m not a huge fan of ordering things without trying them on first or seeing it physically before making a purchase of, especially when I’m entering in acct info to order. However Nike has been the only website literally where they make me feel valued as a customer and safe to place and order. Also, return policy is AWESOME, especially during COVID, but before the pandemic, the satisfaction with your product is why I continue to shop occasionally thru the App or Online with Nike, beats lines at the outlet. Privacy is also guaranteed (through my experience) and if you return an item,  the refund took less then a week, which isn’t bad compared to 10-14 business days.

I generally get my shoes from a retailer like Academy, but i thought I’d have better options directly from the source. It was working great and I was really excited picking out “favorites” to store for future use. I had this app less then a day and it does not work. It locked me out and continues to say access denied. ????? \n\nIve tried logging in, trying to create a new account, using wifi, using my data, using the web browser, clearing my entire data. Nothing works. I deleted the app and redownloaded and that worked for all of 5 min and then it shut me out. Honestly super annoying. I went to file a claim with there online chat support- and after filling out all the info i hit submit and what do you know? It did not submit and sent me to the same access denied page. \n\nSo i had to call for support and the lady said they would email me in 3-5 business days on ways to fix the issue. I asked what do i do if it still doesnt work and she said call back and they will follow up with another email. Not much help. \n\nAt this point I’m both disappointed, frustrated, and annoyed. I literally JUST wanted to order some shoes. But if the issue is not resolved after this first email i doubt i will be calling back again.","title":"Annoyed","userName":"LizAllen116"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"387771637","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"911130812","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"301521403","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1163404732","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1449855096","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1487733219","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"994624624","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1072898300","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"934030757","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"585672038","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"905940653","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1288719040","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1477500619","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1410341892","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1211125805","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1375706708","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"301521406","type":"media/developer","attributes":{"genreNames":[],"name":"Nike, Inc","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/nike-inc/id301521406"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6024","type":"media/genre","attributes":{"name":"Shopping","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/id6024","parentName":"App Store","parentId":"36"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6004","type":"media/genre","attributes":{"name":"Sports","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/id6004","parentName":"App Store","parentId":"36"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1095459556-ios","type":"media/app-platform","attributes":{"bundleId":"com.nike.omega","editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"height":1080,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features128/v4/d4/63/40/d46340cb-5c5d-067b-d43f-efd67a3da360/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"aeb1b4","textColor1":"0d1016","textColor2":"262421","textColor3":"2d3036","textColor4":"41403f"},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"height":1080,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features123/v4/89/ba/fd/89bafd13-bb8b-edb5-0747-d124fc5b17d6/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"b8b3af","textColor1":"0c0c0c","textColor2":"2c201e","textColor3":"2e2d2c","textColor4":"483e3b"},"bannerUber":{"width":4320,"height":1080,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features113/v4/85/ec/d5/85ecd5dc-3c33-c7d8-8957-e765af686c03/source/{w}x{h}sr.{f}","bgColor":"000000","textColor1":"dbdad8","textColor2":"c7c2c2","textColor3":"afaead","textColor4":"9f9b9b"},"brandLogo":{"width":1080,"height":1080,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features114/v4/1e/8d/c6/1e8dc6b1-0046-d718-088f-763b387b9fb3/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"000000","textColor1":"f2f2f2","textColor2":"e5e5e5","textColor3":"c1c1c1","textColor4":"b7b7b7"}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"A dedicated Nike store, tailored to you","tagline":"Shop with AR, save with Apple Pay"},"hasInAppPurchases":false,"hasMessagesExtension":false,"isAppleWatchSupported":false,"isGameCenterEnabled":false,"isHiddenFromSpringboard":false,"isSiriSupported":false,"releaseDate":"2016-08-02T00:00:00.000Z","requiresGameController":false,"subtitle":"Sneakers + fashion shopping","supportsGameController":false,"supportsPassbook":true,"copyright":"© Copyright 2021 Nike, Inc.","description":{"standard":"New sport equipment, the latest shoe releases, daily fashion and athletic stories to inspire you.
