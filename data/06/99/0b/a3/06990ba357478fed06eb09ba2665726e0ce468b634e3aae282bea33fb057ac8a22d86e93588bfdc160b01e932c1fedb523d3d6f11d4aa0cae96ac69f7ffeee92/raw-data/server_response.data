        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Last update made the app very unreliable for me. I open the app and I see all my devices but when I tap on them they just don’t respond. Force closing the app sometimes gets them to work. I have Siri shortcuts set through ifttt. They work reliably. I also have voice commands through google home mini that work reliably. It’s just the eWeLink app that gives me trouble now. Devices have been fantastic otherwise. Just wish the app was reliable.<br /><br />I figured out the reliability problem for me is related to newer Lan Mode feature. Found the setting to turn it off for each switch and now everything works fine. That’s a shame though. My internet has gone out and left me unable to<br />Control switches remotely. Be great to have this feature working reliably.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>The eWeLink app makes setup &amp; configuration of smart devices very easy.  I used the app with a Sonoff 4ch Pro.  Within 10 minutes out of the box i had the Sonoff 4ch Pro working properly.  This time includes installing &amp; registering the eWeLink app, connecting the Sonoff 4ch Pro to wireless, updating the firmware and even adding the skill to Alexa.  <br /><br />The eWeLink app is great, you can change the inching (momentary) settings for each switch, including the duration.  There are a lot of other  settings for the Sonoff 4ch Pro that can be adjusted through the app.<br /><br />*Keep in mind, during initial configuration the eWeLink app will connect the smart device to the wireless network that your mobile device is using.  After configuration your mobile device will be able to control the smart device through the eWeLink app from any network.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This company rocks! They can turn any home into an automated master luxury home. The price for the components is lower than any other and the quality is top notch.<br />Really anyone that can’t give a 5 star positive review obviously is unqualified to be working with electrical devices.<br />This stuff is fully integrated with Alexa and Google Home, I use eWeLink and Alexa and with just a voice command I can turn on and off most anything that has one of their devices. With a few keystrokes you can automate events like grow lights, watering pumps for your lawn and garden or simply turn lights on and off when your on vacation. Even get warnings on your phone when your away if a door or window is opened.</p>

It is all in hours and minutes.  Instructions on how to use these features is basically non-existent.  Do you pick the hours and minutes from the time you are programming or are they real times?   If the scheduling actually used real times, not hours and minutes , let you select am or pm and choose your time zone it would be ideal.  So disappointed, the reason we purchased this unit was due to the ability to schedule the heater to come on and shut off through the app.","title":"Not impressed","userName":"Very disappointed 12"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3762412342","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-02-12T18:20:39Z","rating":5,"review":"you need to spend a little time to figureout, instructions doesnot really fit, however i love the sonnoff and the app, i use it with google home mini and it works great, i connected the switch on one of my extension cord therefore i can switch anything i have connected which doesnt have not high voltages like heater and ac mostly they require ground and the wires get heated, it says 10amp but i dont think it is a good idea for this non grounding wifi connector. also be sure you ve connected correctly live with L, neutral with N input and output.","title":"great","userName":"Massage mania"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1583507705","type":"media/in-app","attributes":{"description":{"standard":"All features, Web, IFTTT, Keyboard and more"},"isMerchandisedEnabled":true,"isMerchandisedVisibleByDefault":true,"isSubscription":true,"name":"Annual subscription","offerName":"member.1year.subscribe","releaseDate":"2009-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","subscriptionFamilyId":"20873435","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/annual-subscription/id1035163158?offerName=member.1year.subscribe"},"relationships":{"artwork":{"data":{"type":"image","id":"ember15367786"}},"offers":{"data":[{"id":"ember15367787","type":"offer"}]}}},{"id":"1583507452","type":"media/in-app","attributes":{"description":{"standard":"all eWeLink advanced features."},"isMerchandisedEnabled":false,"isMerchandisedVisibleByDefault":false,"isSubscription":true,"name":"Subscribe monthly","offerName":"member.1month.subscribe","releaseDate":"2009-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","subscriptionFamilyId":"20873435","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/subscribe-monthly/id1035163158"},"relationships":{"offers":{"data":[{"id":"ember15367788","type":"offer"}]}}},{"id":"1356513143","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1138251146","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1450257910","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1034649547","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1084990073","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1385561119","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1218953994","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1493268178","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"989049956","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1386033880","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1468614367","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"876323966","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1035163157","type":"media/developer","attributes":{"genreNames":[],"name":"深圳酷宅科技有限公司","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/%E6%B7%B1%E5%9C%B3%E9%85%B7%E5%AE%85%E7%A7%91%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%89%E9%99%90%E5%85%AC%E5%8F%B8/id1035163157"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6002","type":"media/genre","attributes":{"name":"Utilities","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/id6002","parentName":"App Store","parentId":"36"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6012","type":"media/genre","attributes":{"name":"Lifestyle","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/id6012","parentName":"App Store","parentId":"36"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1035163158-ios","type":"media/app-platform","attributes":{"bundleId":"cc.coolkit.ios.cn","editorialArtwork":{"brandLogo":{"width":1080,"height":1080,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features114/v4/81/06/f6/8106f65f-9dd7-d960-fc6d-102bc3939685/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"000000","textColor1":"f2f2f2","textColor2":"e5e5e5","textColor3":"c1c1c1","textColor4":"b7b7b7"}},"hasInAppPurchases":true,"hasMessagesExtension":false,"isAppleWatchSupported":true,"isGameCenterEnabled":false,"isHiddenFromSpringboard":false,"isSiriSupported":false,"releaseDate":"2015-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","requiresGameController":false,"subtitle":"Works with everything","supportsGameController":false,"supportsPassbook":false,"copyright":"© 2015 深圳酷宅科技有限公司","description":{"standard":"One app, countless devices\neWeLink is the app platform that supports multiple brands of smart devices including Sonoff.
