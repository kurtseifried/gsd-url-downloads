<pre class="message">Package: iceweasel-firegpg
Version: 0.5.dfsg-1
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

Hi, Debian is currently set to release iceweasel-firegpg in Lenny. Unfortunately,
as the firegpg home page explains, version 0.5 suffers from some serious security
problems. It seems that the gist of it is the unsafe creation and destruction of 
3 temp files.

<a href="http://securityvulns.com/Udocument757.html">http://securityvulns.com/Udocument757.html</a>

Upstream did not label their fixing of this in the upstream svn between 0.5.3 and
0.6.0. Three revisions are candidates for the fix: r464, r465, or r467. r467 is the
most likely from a brief glance at the code. However, I do not have the time or
skill to pull the patch from those revisions that will fix this.

I am hopeful that we can get this resolved before Lenny releases without the need
to pull the severely outdated iceweasel-firegpg package, but I&#39;m not sure if that
is possible.

Cheers,
Daniel

&gt; is possible.

Quoting from above&#39;s web site:
When a user receives an encrypted email and asks FireGPG to decrypt it,
FireGPG prompts the user for her passphrase and then creates three
temporary files.  One for the ciphertext, one for the resulting
cleartext (!), and one for the user&#39;s passphrase (!).  The user&#39;s
passphrase is then written to disk, and the temporary file in which it
resides is passed to the gpg executable as a command-line argument. The
cleartext from the decrypt operation is then written to disk as well,
from where it is subsequently read and displayed to the user.  The same
process occurs for emails that are being encrypted and signed.  Notably,
in the latter cases the pre-encrypted cleartext is written to disk, as
is the passphrase for the signing key. 

I think we should rather remove it altogether. The above&#39;s likely only the tip
of the iceberg. Anyone who insists to continue to use firegpg can still
install it through the XPI installer.

Cheers,
        Moritz

I agree with this assessment.  The version of iceweasel-firegpg that is
currently in debian sid should be removed due to its insecure writing of
data (including both decrypted cleartext *and* the user&#39;s password!) to
the filesystem.

This is not something that appears to be resolvable with a simple patch;
the way to resolve it (well, upstream&#39;s way to resolve it) is to
radically alter the way that the plugin interacts with gpg.  This means
shifting from a &quot;write-files, invoke-program, cleanup-files&quot; approach to
a full-fledged inter-process communications model, piping data directly
to and from a child GnuPG process.  If upstream&#39;s choices are the right
way to go, this appears to involve the creation of an
architecture-dependent shared object to handle the IPC itself.  They
appear to have based the IPC object on the IPC used by engimail [0], and
the build process for this object is non-trivial (apparently involving
access to the firefox source during the build) [1].

&gt; Anyone who insists to continue to use firegpg can still
&gt; install it through the XPI installer.

Unfortunately, this is not universally true, since the xpi installer for
0.7.4 (the latest) only contains libipc.so for i386 and amd64 architectures.

If we want to continue to maintain firegpg in lenny, i think we need to
sort out how to build the IPC library separately from the firefox
sources (or to build it against an approximation of the sources, the way
that the enigmail package seems to do).  Even better would be if
iceweasel-firegpg and enigmail could share a dependency on a separate
libmoz-ipc package or something.  (at least until mozilla decides to
integrate libipc into their codebase [2]).  I&#39;m going to keep
investigating how to do this, but i strongly recommend in the meantime
that we remove iceweasel-firegpg 0.5 from sid, if 0.7.4 cannot be
uploaded promptly.

Sorry, i meant to say &quot;debian&quot; instead of &quot;lenny&quot; here (since firegpg is
not in lenny).  While i think that there are some problems with firegpg
(and in particular problems with the current version), i do think that
it would be good to have updated packages in debian at some point.

<pre class="message">People who may be interested in FireGPG in debian--

I&#39;m not sure how much impetus there is to get firegpg back into the
archive right now.  But i&#39;d like to see the tool get wider exposure
where possible, and inclusion in debian could help that.

After talking with Patrick Brunschwig (on enigmail@mozdev.org),
Maximilien Cuony (on <a href="http://forum.getfiregpg.org">http://forum.getfiregpg.org</a>), and Alexander Sack
(on irc://irc.freenode.net/#ubuntu-mozillateam), I crafted some packages
for the latest version of FireGPG (0.7.5).  I want to thank the folks i
spoke to for their valuable insights, which helped me a lot.  Any
mistakes in the packaging are all my own.

These are preliminary packages; i&#39;d love any review people can give.
They make quite large changes to the packaging process, so i&#39;d prefer to
get feedback from Joao (the current maintainer, CC&#39;ed here too) to see
what he&#39;s interested in doing with them.  My previous e-mails to Joao
have gone unanswered, unfortuantely.  Joao, i hope you&#39;re OK!

The changelog entry from my packaging attempt says:

&gt;    * New Upstream Release:
&gt;     - updated to current gmail changes.
&gt;     - fixes writing cleartext and passphrases to temporary files
&gt;       (Closes: #<a href="bugreport.cgi?bug=514386">514386</a>)
&gt;    * dropped &quot;iceweasel-&quot; from package name; this should work with firefox
&gt;      also on systems which have firefox.  Loosened dependency to include
&gt;      iceweasel | firefox
&gt;      (Closes: #<a href="bugreport.cgi?bug=489745">489745</a>)
&gt;    * minimized debian/rules
&gt;    * building xulrunner-ipc internally with custom makefiles.
&gt;    * switched to Architecture: any
&gt;    * bumped Standards-Version to 3.8.1 (no special changes needed)
&gt;    * turned off automatic updates by default.
&gt;      (Closes: #<a href="bugreport.cgi?bug=489889">489889</a>)

You can find the source (and amd64 binaries) here (built against sid):

  <a href="http://lair.fifthhorseman.net/~dkg/src/firegpg/">http://lair.fifthhorseman.net/~dkg/src/firegpg/</a>

Since FireGPG is not in the archive any longer, i don&#39;t consider this
urgent.  But if we want to provide this package in debian, i suspect
something along these lines will be useful.  And I&#39;m willing to take
over maintenance for the package, Joao, if you are considering orphaning it.

Regards,

	--dkg

PS another option for packaging would be to break out the ipc XPCOM
component into its own package (asac had suggested packaging it as a
simple extension, and making firegpg depend on it).  If any other
package in the archive needs this piece in the future (future versions
of enigmail?  a standalone XUL-based OpenPGP keyring management app?),
we should probably consider splitting it out from the firegpg package;
as it currently stands, it seemed simpler to keep it as a single package.

<pre class="message">this is just a note that i&#39;ve mailed Joao roughly about this issue
weekly for the last six weeks (since March 8) and haven&#39;t gotten a
response.  since firegpg is no longer in debian, i&#39;m planning on filing
an ITP to effectively take over the package (and push it through NEW
again) sometime in the next few weeks.  Joao, if you want to hang on to
the package, please let me know.  i don&#39;t mean this as a hijack!

Hi Daniel,

We have talked in pvt. You can make an ITP to generate a new FireGPG package in Debian. The Debian Community needs of this package and I can&#39;t maintain it now. I am temporally unavailable because of some problems.

Thanks for your consideration.

Best regards,

Eriberto - Brazil
