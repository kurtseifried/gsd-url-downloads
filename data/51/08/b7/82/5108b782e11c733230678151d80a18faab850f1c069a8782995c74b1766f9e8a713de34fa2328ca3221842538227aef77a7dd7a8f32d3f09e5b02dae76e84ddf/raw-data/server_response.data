- When AnyDesks looses the keyboard focus, the keys are now released at the remote
  site in order to prevent stuck keys.
- Further improved GUI with high DPI settings.
- Improved the reliability of the direct connection mechanism.




23.03.2016 - 2.2.2
------------------

New Features
- Improved the request elevation feature.  It is now possible to transmit credentials
  for an admin user in case the remote user has limited user rights and does not now
  the admin credentials.
  Furthermore, the feature now supports switching the user (fast user switch) after
  elevation has been successfull.

Fixed Bugs
- Fixed a bug in the automatic remote keyboard layout detection.
- Fixed a rare bug which could lead to AnyDesk being unable to reconnect after a while.
- Improved the clipboard mechanism.  This should solve problems with the clipboard.




03.03.2016 - 2.2.1
------------------

Fixed Bugs
- Fixed a deadlock which could occur when the backend started.  This could lead to
  being unable to connect to a machine ("Waiting for connection") until the machine
  was restarted.
- Fixed a bug where mouse input was falsely denied for certain areas of the screen.




25.02.2016 - 2.2.0
------------------

Fixed Bugs
- Fixed a crash which occured when the monitor was switched several times in Win 8/10.
- Fixed a bug which could cause AnyDesk to transmit inefficiently (low fps) when the
  remote machine was running Windows 8.1 or Windows 10.  This also could lead to
  a slowdown of the target machine.
- The remote cursor was not rendered correctly when the Direct Draw render mode was
  selected.  The Direct Draw renderer now draws the remote cursor as intended.
- A black image was shown instead of the remote screen in certain cases when "Use fast
  render method" was selected in the view options.  The image is rendered normally now
  if this mode is selected.
- If a 16 bpp mode is selected, the Direct Draw renderer now tests if a 32 bpp mode is
  supported before falling back to the gdi renderer when the lower mode is not supported
  by the hardware.  The d3d renderer now supports 16 bpp colour depth as well and uses
  the same fallback mechanism.
- In some cases, AnyDesk did not transmit any image (black image) when the screen was
  rotated in Windows 7 with Aero enabled.
- The base64 password feature for anydesk: links did not work with all configurations.
  Fixed.
- The forbidden cursor is displayed correctly again.
- The grey tray icon indicating that the AnyDesk service is not running is displayed
  correctly again.
- Under certain conditions, connections to a machine failed with "desk_rt_ipc_error".
  This occured when AnyDesk was not installed.  Added a workaround for these machines.
- AnyDesk now uses the monitor which is currently displaying the AnyDesk window when
  going to fullscreen mode.
- AnyDesk is now scaled correctly with high dpi settings.
- AnyDesk now correctly terminates the session when it is stopped during fullscreen mode.

New Features
- AnyDesk now supports keyboard translation.  If your keyboard layout is different from
  the keyboard layout of the remote user, AnyDesk can translate the keys.  This enables
  you to type special characters on your keyboard regardless if the remote keyboard
  supports them.  You can disable this feature in the main menu in case you want raw key
  to be transmitted.  This is useful for example for playing games which depend on the
  hardware key code.
- Select "Auto-Adjust resolution" from the main menu during a session in order to change
  the remote screen resolution to fit the dimensions of your local AnyDesk window.  You
  can use this feature as often as needed, for example after you maximized the AnyDesk
  window.  After the session ends, the remote resolution is restored to the original mode.
- Added privacy tab to user settings. You can now decide what to broadcast, your windows
  user name or a custom one, your windows account image, a custom one or none.




17.12.2015 - 2.1.2
------------------

Fixed Bugs

  following scheme:  "anydesk:address@ad:cGFzc3dvcmQ=".  The password has to be in base64
  encoding.
- new parameter --auto-close:  This indicates to AnyDesk that it should auto-quit the
  frontend window when there are no more sessions.
- new config option for customized AnyDesk:  It is now possible to disable the different
  tabs in the settings dialog using the client generator of the web console.




21.10.2015 - 2.1.1
------------------

Fixed Bugs
- Fixed a bug where it was not possible to move the mouse in remote desktop protocol sessions.
- The state of scroll lock, caps lock and num lock gets now restored when the last session
  ends.
- Performance optimization for the d3d renderer in original view mode.
- Improved menu bar in fullscreen mode of the ddraw renderer (used in windows xp).  The menu
  bar disappeared in certain cases.  It stays always on top now and is automatically hidden
  after two seconds.  Put the mouse cursor on the screen edge to display it again.
- AnyDesk would not start if there was a misconfiguration with the user app data folder.
  Instead, an error message box was displayed.  AnyDesk uses the local app data folder as
  a fallback now.
- Terminating AnyDesk now requires admin privileges.

New Features
- Zoom text size in chat with mouse wheel and +/-

21.08.2015 - 2.0.1
------------------

Fixed Bugs
- In some cases, unicode text was not correctly transmitted over the clipboard.  This lead
  to the text being put on the clipboard as "???????".  AnyDesk now always sends unicode text,
  if available.
- Under certain conditions, the clipboard synchronization stayed engaged if it was disabled
  in the settings tab or the accept window.
- Fixed the remote mouse cursor position in original view mode.

New Features
- New performance option for rendering ("Use fast render method").  Set the checkbox as follows:
  Checked: Always uses 16 bits per pixel for uploading (decreases required memory bandwidth).
           Use this setting to speed up rendering on slow machines.
  Indeterminate (default behaviour): Use the 16 bit render mode on single processor systems.
  Unchecked: Never use 16 bits per pixel mode.  Uncheck if you have a single processor machine
  but the image quality is too low.
- Added translation to Korean.
- Added "Waiting for first frame" dialog which is displayed as soon as the network connection
  is established.
- Added a new command line option --get-status to get the connection status and improved the
  behaviour on errors of the command line interface.

  from the security tab are now applied for sessions.
- If the alias is too long for display, a smaller font is used.
- Fixed a rare crash when the mouse cursor had an invalid pixel format.
- The "Show remote cursor" feature displayed the mouse cursor in an incorrect position for all
  monitors except the first monitor.  The cursor is displayed now correctly.
- Updated translations

-----------------------

Fixed Bugs
- Improved the network code.  This adds to the overall performance and fixes some random connection
  freezes which occured in rare cases.
- Windows 8: When no mouse was attached to the machine being controlled, the mouse cursor was
  missing.  Provided a workaround which enables the mouse cursor during the AnyDesk session.
- Fixed a bug in the d3d renderer on multi monitor systems which caused the display to turn grey
  when the AnyDesk window reached a certain size.
